Macaw: A Mesoscale Ablation Modeling Tool
=====

Macaw was developed to model the ablation of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) Thermal Protection System (TPS) at the mesoscale. Macaw was developed in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Florida, and supported by the Early Stage Innovations (ESI) NASA Grant 80NSSC18K0250. It now also includes the functionality to model carbon/carbon woven fiber systems.

Macaw is an application based on the MOOSE Framework (https://www.mooseframework.org/). MOOSE is a nonlinear finite element solver developed by the Idaho National Laboratory. It is an open-source code with community development on GitHub (https://github.com/idaholab/moose), where you can find a discussion board with Q&A (https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions). 

To use Macaw, you need to first install MOOSE (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/index.html) on your machine. We refer the user to the MOOSE website, where you can find the most up-to-date instructions on how to install and update MOOSE.

After MOOSE is up and running correctly, you can start using Macaw. The usage is similar to any MOOSE-based app: 

1.	Fork Macaw on GitHub
2.	Clone your fork
3.	Build Macaw on your local machine
4.	Run Macaw’s tests

There are tests and example input files that can be used as a starting point. There is also a word document user guide named MacawUserGuide.docx located in the main macawupdated folder that has more instructions including a full walkthrough of creating a simple 2D woven fiber oxidation example.

For details on the mathematical model development, we refer the user to the following papers: …
